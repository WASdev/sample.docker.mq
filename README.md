# Running the WebSphere Liberty and IBM MQ images in Containers with Docker Compose

The files in this project accompany a [WASdev](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/docs/using-docker-compose-configure-topology-websphere-liberty-ibm-mq/) article and
illustrate how Docker Compose can be used to stand up a topology with IBM MQ
being used to communicate between two applications running on WebSphere Liberty.

The two applications can be built using the `build` script and the sample can
then be run using `docker-compose up`. See the article for full details.
